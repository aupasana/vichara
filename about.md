lakṣaṇa-pramāṇābhyām vastu-siddhiḥ -- to know a vastu is 
to understand the lakṣaṇa and pramāṇas for it.

#### for the vidvān

Traditional study with śāstra maryādā starts with the tarka saṅgraha, 
artha saṅgraha, vedānta paribhāṣā and siddhānta leśa saṅgraha. 
Upon completion, the vidvān masters the prasthāna traya bhāṣya.

#### for the gr̥hastha

Gr̥hasthas can study the texts below which teach the same siddhānta, 
but are written in far simple saṁskr̥t.

**prakaraṇa texts** --

1. [tattva bodha](/tattvabodha) -- a first primer, which introduces the main topics
2. [vicāra candrodaya](/chandra) -- an intermediate primer, with more precise lakṣaṇas
3. [vicāra sāgara](/sagara) -- a comprehensive primer, covering all major prakriyās

**prasthāna traya** --
Simple bhāṣyas on the prasthāna traya, which teach the siddhānta, and 
retain the words of bhāṣyakāra where possible.

1. [upaniṣads](/upanishads) -- with the prasāda and maṇiprabhā commentaries
2. [brahma sūtra](/sutra) -- with the vidyānanda and tattva prakāśikā vr̥ttis
3. [bhagavad gītā](/gita) -- with the śrīdharī vyākhyā

#### about this site

The purpose of this site is threefold

1. Publicize these traditional texts and make them generally available
2. Make them accessible with simple translations that help intermediate saṁskr̥ta readers
3. Serve as a platform for manana

#### about the translations

While translations are provided here and there, they are
meant as a temporary aid to help read the original samskr̥t. 
For some portions, the initial translations were done by AI
tools. Our focus is on the samṣkr̥t text, and not on the correctness
of the translations.
