<!-- skt-start -->
आत्मनः जननाभावे, मरणमपि न भवति। जननमरणाभावे जायते, अस्ति, वर्धते, विपरिणमते, अपक्षीयते, नश्यति इति षट्विकाराः न भवन्ति। 
<!-- skt-end -->

<!-- eng-start -->
In the absence of ātma having a beginning, it cannot have an end. And in the absence of a beginning, it will not have any of the six vikāras -- i.e. to be born, to exist, to grow, to change, to decay and to cease to exist.
