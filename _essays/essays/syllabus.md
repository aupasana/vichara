### saṁskr̥t and śāstra

Fluency in [saṁskr̥t](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/panchatantra-of-vishnu-sharma-mzb882/) is necessary to read the prasthāna traya with bhāṣya. Study portions of the [pañcatantra](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/panchatantra-of-vishnu-sharma-mzb882/) and [bhāsa’s plays](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/bhasa-nataka-chakram-nzy892/) with sudhākar mālavīya’s ṭīkā, perferrably in saṁskr̥t medium. You also need to understand how traditional study of śāstra works. Study the [tarka saṅgraha with padakr̥tya](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/tarka-sangraha-of-annambhtta-nzj458/) (or study another introductory śāstra text in a traditional way).

### vedānta essentials

We can now study vedānta in saṁskr̥t. First study the [tattva bodha](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/tattva-bodha-and-atma-bodha-mzw105/) – a short prose text. Then study the [saṁskr̥ta vicāra sāgara](https://vichara.aupasana.com) – a comprehensive prose text. This covers – end to end – all the fundamentals of vedānta as a śāstra. The hard work is largely complete.

### upaniṣads, gīta, brahma sūtras

It is useful to be familiar with the prasthāna traya texts before studying the bhāṣya. The bhāṣya is has many cross-references and sometimes covers many topics at once. First study the [upaniṣads with the gloss by amaradāsa](https://archive.org/details/ekadasopanishadah-with-maniprabha-tika-of-swami-amaradasa-udasina-1910-nsp) – starting with the kaṭha, muṇḍaka and taittirīya upaniṣads. Then study the [gītā with śrīdhara’s](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-with-translation-sridharaswamykrit-explanation-number-2297-uav854/) short commentary. Finally, study the [brahma sūtrās with vidyānanda’s vr̥tti](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutram-mzw047/). You have now studied the original prasthāna traya texts.

### śaṅkarācārya’s bhāṣya

We can consider what we have studied so far the brief (laghu) study of the prasthāna traya. You are now well equipped to study bhāṣyakāra’s commentaries directly. You should also attend AVG’s long term course, or do śravaṇa using the [recordings](https://avrpt.com/). Once that is complete, you can optionally study advanced texts such as the advaita siddhi.

### timeline

A serious student should expect to study for at least an hour a day. In the first 5 years, you might complete saṁskr̥t and the vedānta essentials. In the second 5 years, you might complete the prasthāna traya bhāṣya. And in another 5 years, you might complete the long term course. 

If you think this is too long, develop patience. Titīkṣā is a necessary prerequisite for any serious student of vedānta !
