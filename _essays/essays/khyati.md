# perception and khyāti

This diagram below presents a simplified view of perception and error.
The lakṣaṇas for khyāti and their causes are not described here.

1. We can see objects as they are. In sunlight, we perceive the pot as is.

2. Error can occur in the objects themselves. The sky appears blue. A crystal placed on a red flower appears red. The eyes and mind are not causing bhrama.

3. Error can occur in our eyes. We may see two suns in the sky, or a blurry sun. The mind and object are not causing bhrama.

4. When the mind is not focused on an object, the object isn't perceived -- with or without error. The eyes and object are not causing bhrama.

5. Error can occur in our mind. When a rope is not fully visible, or the eye does not properly function, we fill in the details with previous impressions and perceive other objects.

<em>Thus, cognition occurs at the intersection -- where the mind, through the senses, contacts the perceivable object.</em>

The mind doesn't distinguish between a crystal that appears red, or a crystal that is red. It perceives a red crystal -- which it may have projected there!
The mind regularly projects objects on the site of attention -- where the mind pervades the object through the sense organs.
