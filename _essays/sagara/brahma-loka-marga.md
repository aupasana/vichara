## a jīva's path to brahma loka

The path of a jīva who goes to brahma loka after death is described in [āvarta 310](/sagara/5/310). 

1. agni takes the liṅga śarīra from bhū loka to agni loka
1. aha takes it to from agni loka to aha loka
1. śukla pakśa takes it from aha loka to śukla pakṣa loka 
1. uttarāyaṇa takes it from śukla pakṣa loka to uttarāyaṇa loka
1. samvatsara takes it from uttarāyaṇa to samvatsara loka
1. deva takes it from samvatsara loka to deva loka
1. vāyu takes it from deva loka to vāyu loka
1. sūrya takes it from vāyu loka to sūrya loka
1. candra takes it from sūrya loka to candra loka
1. vidyut takes it from candra loka to vidyut loka
1. amānava and vidyut take it from vidyut loka to varuṇa loka
1. amānava and varuṇa take it from varuṇa loka to indra loka
1. amānava and indra take it from indra loka to prajāpati loka
1. amānava alone takes it from prajāpati loka to brahma loka

There are three phases

1. From agni to vidyut, the devatā takes the liṅga śarīra to their own loka
2. From vidyut to indra, the devatā follows amānava who takes it from their loka to the next loka
3. No devatā goes beyond prajāpati loka. Amānava alone goes from prajāpati loka to brahma loka
