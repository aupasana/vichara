<div class="diagram_title">Diagram 1: Which jñāna destroys which ajñāna</div>

ajñāna and āvaraṇa result in the following three expressions: 
1. I don't know brahman (aham brahma na jāne)
2. Brahman is not evident (brahma na bhāti)
3. There is no brahman (brahma nāsti) 

Only the cause of the expression 'brahma nāsti (there is no brahman)' 
is destroyed by parokṣa jñāna of brahman. The other two are destroyed
by aparokṣa jñāna. This is partially discussed in question 1.9 below.

In this section, parokṣa (indirect) brahma jñāna is discussed.
